RoboSub Testing Onboarding
====================

We currently have a couple of main tasks that we want to accomplish:
* Model the course (in both software and hardware)
* Contact Duke Aquatics to utilize testing areas (pool)
* Plan the course of attack: i.e. determine the optimal route/points the AUV should take

Future tasks include:
* Creating a testing course for the AUV
* Design and create transportation modules to ensure safety of the AUV


##### CURRENT WORK:

To get up to speed, please go to the [RoboSub website] (http://www.auvsifoundation.org/competitions/robosub/robosubteamcentral) and become familiar with the [manual](http://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AUVSI/fb9a8da0-2ac8-42d1-a11e-d58c1e158347/UploadedFiles/RoboSub%20Competition%20Official%20Rules%20and%20Mission%20-%202015.pdf).  Specifically, understand the *types* of tasks that exist, rather than the specific task listed in the manaul.  This is because the Official Rules of the 2015-2016 AUV have not yet been announced.

As of now, the software of modelling has not yet been chosen.  Check back in a couple of days for further information and instructions as for software installation.
