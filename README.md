#Duke Robotics Club Onboarding

Welcome to Duke Robotics Club! We wanted to put together a centralized place with all of the information you need to get up to speed and become and active contributing member of the organization.

This repository is structured in the following way: this document outlines the onboarding process that is the same for all new members and below are links to the additional onboarding steps for the various subsystem teams. Please follow the instructions on this document as well as the onboarding instructions for the team you are specifically interested in working with. We're looking forward to having you join our team!
