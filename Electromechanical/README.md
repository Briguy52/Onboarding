RoboSub Electromechanical Onboarding
====================

* Get Solidworks from OIT
  * [Email the help desk](http://it.pratt.duke.edu/node/77) and request access to the network directory that contains the installer
  * Specify that it is for the Robotics Club and it is for educational use only _not research._
  * Once granted access, [install it](http://it.pratt.duke.edu/node/82)
* Start learning to use Solidworks ASAP
  * Duke offers access to [Lynda](http://oit.duke.edu/comp-print/training/online/lynda.php), which has some good getting started videos
  * Become familiar with basic sketch tools, 3D features, assemblies, and design library features
  * I also like [this guy's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvBoZ6kH3Q8) because he just walks through some best practices in a less structured way-good way to see what's possible.
* Get on the GrabCAD. The best way to do this is just to tell me to add your gmail. You'll get an email prompting you to make an account.
* Get machine shop certified
  * Thusfar, we've been farming out a lot of the machining, but it's still crucial that we all be able to machine, especially once we get around to assembling the whole thing.
* Read the old meeting notes on Google Drive
  * While hardly complete, these notes can offer some insight into the thinking that's already done, which should hopefully help you become an engaged member of the team as quickly as possible.
* Check EMechanical Trello cards to see subprojects that might interest you beyond our design meetings-as the semester continues and the design is finalized, these subtasks will become the primary focus of the team
